                <p>Web development simply means the process of creating and maintaining websites and includes various
                    facets like web design, web programming, database management, and web publishing. To put it in a
                    nutshell, the answer to “what is web development?” is that it includes all the activities related to
                    the creation of applications that function on the is, websites.</p>

                <p>One area that Ive leaped and bounded through is accepting that I am Bernie Macs daughter. Part of accepting 
                    that has been talking about him and our relationship. I used to do it out of a sense of duty and obligation. 
                    After all, Im his only child. I am the biggest chunk of his legacy. Who will carry his torch if not I? It was 
                    difficult in the beginning. Sometimes I would feel worse after</p>

                <p>Last month, the U.S. Surgeon General named “mattering at work” a top priority for improving
                     mental health. The announcement reaffirms what weve known for many years: Mattering and 
                     well-being are inseparable, especially where humans spend 35% of their waking lives.The
                      official call to prioritize mattering at work is the culmination of several conspiring 
                      forces reshaping what work means to and in our lives.</p>

                <p>In 1592, the playwright and satirist Thomas Nashe wrote a pamphlet called “Pierce Penniless: 
                    His Supplication to the Devil” in which a broke student asks the devil for money in exchange 
                    for news about the seven deadly sins in London. The massively popular pamphlet served as an 
                    alternative to a play during a time when theaters were closed due to the plague, which kind 
                    of makes Nashe the Bo Burnham of the 1590s, dropping a wild and funny “pandemic album” to
                     entertain a beleaguered public during a crisis.</p>

                    Ah yes, here it is: war is hell.
                    Thats why its always the best idea not to start any.
                    ….is just a reminder for all those who cant stop complaining about me not writing any of My
                    reports/summaries/updates for the last four days. And for those who cant stop complaining
                     and posting knee-jerk reactions in response to my anti-Israel commentaries in the Part 3 of my analysis of the air war.
